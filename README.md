Ever wanted to easily type numbers in genotheta??? No?????Â What the hell are you doing with your life!!!!!

## Genotheta
If youâ€™re here you probably know what that is, but in case you donâ€™t: genotheta is a constructed script (more like a substitution cypher, really) created by artifyber, an Indonesian furry artist. Itâ€™s prominently used in her art and in very little else. Genotheta letters all look like gender symbols, which automatically makes it about one thousand orders of magnitude better than Latin.

While genotheta letters have a 1:1 correspondence to the standard Latin alphabet (plus a few optional digraphs), genotheta _numbers_ are a different beast. It uses a duotrigesimal (base-32) system that basically boils down to vertically-written binary with a couple of stems to close it off as a single character. It sounds confusing when describing it with words, but I guarantee that if you understand binary, youâ€™ll instantly understand genotheta numerals once you look at them.

## KittyMath???
Using KittyMath is very simple: type a decimal number on the top box and the corresponding duotrigesimal number will instantly appear on the bottom box. You can click **Copy** to copy. Crazy stuff, huh!!!! You can also tyâ€“ uuuuh _paste_ genotheta numbers on the bottom box and the corresponding arabic number will appear up top. No copy button for that, though, use your fingers.

## System requirements
none!!!!!! fr ts probably can run on windows 2000 lol i made it in an ancient version of delphi

## FAQ
- **Wait a goddamn minute, how are you typing genotheta numerals???**\
With a custom font, duh. Arti has her own genotheta font, but as far as I know, thatâ€™s private. So I made my own font. With blackjack and hookers. The numerals are encoded on the first 32 characters of the Private Use Area, so theyâ€™re neat and easy to work with. Iâ€™ll sure eventually properly publish the font family somewhere, but for now you can just download ArtitypeD.ttf from the source and install it locally, I guess (KittyMath does not require the font to be installed to work or display properly).
- **Who the hell are you????**\
I donâ€™t know either! lmk if you find that out
- **ugly aah app ðŸ’€**\
Agreed. Iâ€™m a worse designer than a coder. If you wanna yassify it, pull requests and forks are more than welcome. Same goes for the crappy icon I whipped up in two minutes on Paint.NET.
